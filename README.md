# sms_spam_detector
##
### Description:
The assignment was to refactor code from an SMS text classification 
solution into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector 
Classification (SVC) model and then create and run a Gradio app to 
classify sms messages as spam or not spam. If the input box already has a 
message, hit clear.  If the results are spam, you can hit flag to confirm
the model's results - if that result was a false-positive.


### Usage:
Run the file gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb.  Then copy and paste the 
sample emails into the gradio app under Enter your SMS message and hit sumbit
 to see if spam or not spam.

### Resources:
The completed assignment is in gradio_sms_text_classification.ipynb. The 
resource file - SMSSpamCollection.csv was provided with the assignement. 

### Known Issues:
I wrote is in Colab but could not get the file to export to GitHub so downloaded it as a python file. 
I think it worked ok but my input screen was different than the example.

### Acknowledgements:
I used sms_text_classification_solution.ipynb for help to set everything up 
Then on Xpert Asst to help with the Gradio app.
